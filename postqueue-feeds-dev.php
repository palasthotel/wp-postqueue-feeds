// The version above is deliberately not a real one and nothing syncs it. This file never
// ships, so its version means nothing - and while the release pipeline did insist that it
// matched, a decorative number could block a release. "Tested up to" is not a plugin
// header field at all; WordPress only reads that from readme.txt.

// Lets the repository be symlinked into wp-content/plugins as a whole while the plugin
// itself stays in public/, the directory bin/pack.sh packs and the release deploys.
